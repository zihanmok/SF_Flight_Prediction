# SF_Flight_Prediction

## Project goal:
Predict the Delayed Status of the Flights Depart from SFO

## Data sources :
a. Flights Dataset: United States Department of Transportation
   - Data size: 2.12G
   - Description: Monthly flights of the United States from 2013 to 2015
   - For this project, around 500,000 flights departure from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) are extracted.

b. Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017: Kaggle
   - Data size: 52.5MB
   - Description: Hourly weather data for 30 US & Canadian Cities + 6 Israeli CitiesÂ¶
   - For this project, weather conditions in SF from 2013 to 2015 are extracted.
